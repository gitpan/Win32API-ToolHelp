Win32API/ToolHelp version 0.02
==============================

The functions provided by the ToolHelp library make it easier for you
to obtain information about currently executing applications. These functions
are designed to streamline the creation of tools, specifically debuggers.

It covers enumerating the currently running processes and their modules,
traversing heaps, listing threads and taking snapshots of memory
of the currently running processes. The results are return in a form
as close as possible to the original Win32 API (simple types are returned
as scalars of the same type and structures are returned as references to hashes
with keys of the same names as the members of the original structures have).
There are all functions of the ToolHelp library implemented in this module.

The support for the ToolHelp library API is included in Windows 95
or higher or in Windows 2000 or higher. It is not included in Windows NT. See
the module Win32API::ProcessStatus for the similar functionality
for Windows NT.
